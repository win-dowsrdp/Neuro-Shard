# Neuro-Shard
Project Goal: To build an open-source, decentralized framework that stress-tests and benchmarks the performance of Nosana's GPU nodes for running quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama-3 and Mixtral.


Project Statement: Neuro-Shard solves the "reliability gap" in decentralized compute. By rigorously stress-testing consumer-grade GPUs on the Nosana network, we provide a verified "Performance Score" for node operators, ensuring that AI developers can trust the stability and throughput of the decentralized grid for production-level inference.


# Neuro-Shard: Distributed Inference Benchmarking

Neuro-Shard is a Python-based framework designed to stress-test decentralized GPU nodes.
It executes continuous PyTorch tensor operations to measure thermal stability and throughput over extended periods.

## Status
Pre-Alpha. Internal testing only.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Sentinel Agent Development
